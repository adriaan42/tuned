.TH TUNED_ADM "8" "30 Mar 2017" "Fedora Power Management SIG" "tuned"
.SH NAME
tuned\-adm - commandline tool for switching between different tuning profiles
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tuned\-adm 
.RB [ list " | " active " | " "profile \fI<profile>\fP" " | " off " | " verify " | " recommend ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
This command line utility allows you to switch between user definable tuning
profiles. Several predefined profiles are already included. You can even
create your own profile, either based on one of the existing ones by copying
it or make a completely new one. The distribution provided profiles are stored
in subdirectories below \fI/usr/lib/tuned\fP and the user defined profiles in
subdirectories below \fI/etc/tuned\fP. If there are same profiles on both places,
user defined profiles have precedence.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.SS
.TP
.B list
List all available profiles.

.TP
.B active
Show current active profile.

.TP
.BI "profile " PROFILE
Switches to the given profilename. If none is given or no valid one is given
the command gracefully exits without performing any operation.

.TP
.B verify
Verifies current profile against system settings. Outputs information whether
system settings matches current profile or not (e.g. somebody modified
sysfs/sysctl value by hand). Detailed information what is checked, what
value is set and what value is expected can be found in the log.

.TP
.B recommend
Recommend profile suitable for your system. Currently only static detection is
implemented - it decides according to data in /etc/system\-release\-cpe and
virt\-what output. The rules for autodetection are defined in recommend.conf in
profile directory. They can be overriden by user by putting the recommend.conf
into /etc/tuned. The default rules recommend profiles targeted to the best
performance or balanced profile if unsure.

.TP
.B off
Unload tunings.
